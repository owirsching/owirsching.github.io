            <p class="title">About Me</p>
            <p class="description">I have always had a passion for problem-solving. In high school I focused heavily on math and physics courses, planning to make theoretical physics my career. However, I did not stick to that plan. During my first semester in college, I took Introduction to Computer Science and absolutely fell in love with software engineering. Solving problems with code not only allows you to reach a solution but gives you the creative power to build the function itself. Since then, I have dedicated myself to computer science. For my college courses, I have taken Data Structures, Algorithms, and Principles of Programming Languages. 
            </p>
            <p class="description">Outside of school I have completed online learning to supplement my coursework. During the winter break of my freshman year, I taught myself HTML, CSS, Git, and Github in order to build my personal website (owirsching.github.io). This past winter break I took courses on SQL and React. Learning outside of the classroom has affirmed my passion for software engineering and desire to continue with coding after college. 
                Although I found this new love for software engineering after high school, I never stopped enjoying math. That is why I have declared a double major in both computer science and mathematics. To further my knowledge in this field, I have taken classes in Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning, and Probability. </p>
            <p class="description">Standing at the intersection of these two subjects - computer science and mathematics - is data science. That is where I currently have my sights set for a career. In order to gain more experience in this field, I am working as a software engineering intern with The Philadelphia Phillies this coming summer. With the Phillies, I hope to gain knowledge about technical applications in the real world, learn how math and computer science work together, and build professional experience. </p>
            <p class="description">Going forward, I hope to apply my experiences to help others reach the same career goals. That is why this semester I will be volunteering with Girls Who Code to teach computer science fundamentals to local high school students. As I was entering computer science, I was so grateful to have mentors guiding me through the world of technology. That is why I hope to dedicate myself to mentorship as well as my own professional plans throughout my career.
